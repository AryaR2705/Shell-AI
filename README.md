<span style="font-size:0.5em;">Shell.ai Hackathon 2024: Fleet Decarbonization Challenge</span>

The Shell.ai Hackathon 2024 focusing on optimizing fleet decarbonization strategies in the mobility sector.

# Challenge Overview
The Shell.ai Hackathon aims to address real-world energy challenges through AI-driven solutions. This year's challenge focuses on reducing greenhouse emissions from professional, delivery, and operational fleets while balancing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

# Problem Statement
Fleet owners need to transition to net-zero emissions while meeting demand and adhering to strict carbon emission limits over 16 years (2023-2038). Participants are tasked with developing mathematical models to optimize fleet compositions annually, considering vehicle purchases, usage, and sales.

# Approach
Data Exploration and Preparation
Analyzed provided datasets (demand.csv, vehicles.csv, vehicles_fuels.csv, fuels.csv, carbon_emissions.csv).
Preprocessed data to align with model requirements (e.g., demand forecasts, vehicle specifications, fuel details).
Objective: Minimize total cost of fleet operations while meeting yearly demand and carbon emission constraints.
Implementation Details
Implemented solution in Python code.
Validated results against provided sample format (final.csv).
Handled constraints such as vehicle purchase/sale limits, fuel type compatibility, and carbon emission budgets.
Results
Evaluation : Submitted solutions for both public and private evaluation rounds.
